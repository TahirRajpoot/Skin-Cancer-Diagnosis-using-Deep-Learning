# Skin Cancer Diagnosis using Deep Learning

## Introduction

Skin cancer, particularly melanoma, is a severe health concern globally. Early detection is vital for successful treatment. Traditional biopsy methods are slow and invasive, prompting the need for computer-based detection systems. This project aims to develop a skin cancer detection system using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model.

## Methodology

The project utilizes the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC) 2018 dataset for training. Data pre-processing techniques, including normalization, resizing, and augmentation, are applied. Transfer learning with the VGG-16 architecture is employed for model training. The model is fine-tuned and tested, achieving an accuracy of 89%.

## Conclusion

By leveraging transfer learning and deep learning techniques, the project successfully develops a skin cancer detection system with a fine-tuned VGG-16 model. The high accuracy achieved on test datasets demonstrates the potential for early detection of skin cancer.
